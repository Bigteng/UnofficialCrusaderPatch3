Name: Unofficial Crusader Patcher
ai_access: No demolishing of inaccessible buildings
ai_access_descr: |
  The AI will no longer demolish and rebuild its buildings continuously, when it cannot be reached by a worker.
ai_addattack: change the increase of army per attack wave
ai_addattack_descr: |
  In the Vanilla game each AI lord increases their army by 5 additional units for each main attack. You can adjust the amount here.
ai_addattack_alt_descr: |
  Alternatively, you can let the AI lords increase their army by a percentage of their initial army size, which is unique for each lord.
  Example: Scale factor = 0.5
  Sultan's attack troops = 10, 15, 20, 25, ... 
  Saladin's attack troops = 50, 75, 100, 125, ...
ai_assaultswitch: Disable AI switching attack targets during a siege
ai_assaultswitch_descr: |
  AIs with the target choice set to gold or weakest were sometimes reevaluating who they would attack in the midst of a siege, running their troops across the whole map. With this fix, the AI will stick with their previously chosen target.
ai_attacklimit: Adjust AI limit for recruiting attack troops
ai_attacklimit_descr: |
  In Vanilla the number of main army units is capped at the size of the AI's first attack plus 200. After reaching this limit, the AI stops recruiting troops and no longer sends out attacks.
  NOTE: Very high values can cause the global unit limit to be reached in longer games, resulting in peasants being unable to spawn.
ai_attacktarget: Override AI attack targets
ai_attacktarget_nearest: Nearest enemy
ai_attacktarget_nearest_descr: |
  ' '
ai_attacktarget_richest: Richest Enemy
ai_attacktarget_richest_descr: |
  ' '
ai_attacktarget_weakest: Weakest Enemy
ai_attacktarget_weakest_descr: |
  You can override how all AI lords choose their attack targets.
  NOTE: There is a more granular way to set individual attack target behaviour for AIs inside the AIC by using the ai-swapper module.
ai_attackwave: More active AI attacking behaviour
ai_attackwave_descr: |
  The AI in an attack in vanilla only sends as many troops at once as there are wall parts reachable. This causes units to drop in in small waves when the target castle has a lot of buildings directly at its walls. This option makes units also attack civil and fortification buildings, as well as wall parts which are already being attacked by one unit. Moreover, the AI sends more troops to the enemy lord as soon as it detects a breach.
# we are adding two suboptiosn here for army part split off to attack economy!
ai_buywood: Buy additional wood
ai_buywood_descr: |
  In vanilla, the AI only buys enough wood to construct the building its trying to place, this can result in either not enough wood to be presesent to be used in weapon production or weapon production picking up a piece of wood before the building was placed, resulting in the AI not being able to build the structure. To prevent this issue, 2 additional wood are purchased each time the AI buys wood for construction purposes.
ai_defense: More reliable repleneshing of castle defenders
ai_defense_descr: |
  Fixes a bug which stopped the AI from replacing missing troops on walls and towers, as long as defensive patrols were still around.
# ai_demolish: Deactivate demolishing for money of the AI lords
# need localized category
ai_demolish_eco_descr: |
  If the AI feels pressured, it demolishes its economy or fortification buildings to get quick money for troops. This feature sometimes seems to be triggered without any visible reason and is often not a good strategic move. The following types of demolishing buildings for money can be disabled.
ai_demolish_eco: Econonmy buildings
ai_demolish_trapped: Inaccessible buildings
#ai_demolish_trapped_descr: |
ai_demolish_walls: Fortification buildings
#ai_demolish_walls_descr: |
ai_fix_crusader_archers_pitch: Enable European archers to light pitch
ai_fix_crusader_archers_pitch_descr: |
 AI's European archers light pitch the same way arabian archers do, when defending against enemy units.
ai_fix_laddermen_with_enclosed_keep: Enable enclosed AIs to deploy laddermen
ai_fix_laddermen_with_enclosed_keep_descr: |
  AIs no longer stop assaulting enemy walls with their Laddermen if their own keep is enclosed.
# ai_housing: Let the AI build houses smarter
# need localized category
ai_nosleep: Disable sleep mode for production facilities
ai_nosleep_descr: |
  The AI lords put their production buildings to sleep, if they run out of a resources they depend on for their Industry. E.g. all bakers are put to sleep when Saladin runs out of flour. 
  However, this often disregards goods still being processed or midst their delivery leading to a constant loss of goods.
  Here you can disable this sleep mode for the AI entirely.
ai_resources_rebuy: Improve AI restocking of needed goods
ai_resources_rebuy_descr: |
  The AI often doesn't restock goods even if it has the gold for it, leaving its production chains running dry. This option reduces the amount of time the AI waits for its stocks to be empty before restocking the necessary goods.
ai_noflour_maxtime_descr: |
  Time in 1/12th of months until the AI restocks 2 flour.
ai_noiron_maxtime_descr: |

ai_recruitinterval: Override and maximize recruitment speed
ai_recruitinterval_descr: |
  Sets the recruitment interval of all AIs to the lowest value, recruiting as fast as the Vanilla Rat/Richard.
  NOTE: There is a more granular way to set individual recruitment speed for AIs inside the AIC by using the ai-swapper module.
ai_recruitstate_initialtimer: Set AIs initial time until they recruit according to the AIC parameters
ai_recruitstate_initialtimervalue_descr: |
  Set this value to number of months for which the AI will exclusively recruit defence troops, unless its pool of defense units is full.
ai_tethers: Set ox tethers to a maximum of 10 per AI lord
ai_tethers_descr: |
  Usually, the AI builds a new ox tether for every new quarry it constructs, even if it exceeds the usual limit of 10 ox tethers per lord. This can lead to a spam of ox tethers, reaching the housing limit for an AI lord causing no new peasants to spawn. With this setting you can disable the placement of that extra ox tether when a new quarry is built.
ai_towerengines: Increase the siege engine limit of the AI
ai_towerengines_descr: |
  Usually the AI only builds up to three mangonels and ballistas on its towers. With this option this limit is increased to 5 per engine.
backup_aiv_select: Select Backup AIV folder
build_housing: Set empty housing buffer
build_housing_descr: |
  Set the amount of empty housing space before the AIs will stop to build new houses. This ensures enough space for new peasants to spawn, in vanilla this value is 0.
  This option also prevents the AIs from demolishing their extra houses.
campfire_housing: Set idle peasants buffer
campfire_housing_descr: |
  Set the max amount of peasants at the AIs' campfires, before the AIs stops building new houses. This option also prevents the AIs from demolishing their "extra" houses.

fix_apple_orchard_build_size: Shrink apple orchard's build size
fix_apple_orchard_build_size_descr: |

o_armory_marketplace_weapon_order_fix: Fix armory/marketplace weapon order
o_armory_marketplace_weapon_order_fix_descr: |
  Reorders weapon icons in the armory and the marketplace to be the same. This includes the switching of pages in the market, as well as the display in the main category.

o_change_siege_engine_spawn_position_catapult_descr: |

  Bakers no longer disappear when they don't find flour at their targeted stockpile.
o_fix_fletcher_bug: Fix fletchers inefficient pathing
o_fix_fletcher_bug_descr: |
  Fixes the behaviour where fletchers would go back to their workplace after delivering the bow/crossbow at the armory, instead of going straight to the stockpile to grab wood for the next production cycle.
o_fix_ladderclimb: Units climbing ladders retain their move command target
o_fix_ladderclimb_descr: |

  Deleting buildings with a fast auto clicker no longer deletes the building multiple times. This way you dont get more resources back from deleting than the game has intended.
o_freetrader: Free trading post
o_freetrader_descr: |
  This option makes the trading post cost no resources to prevent the AI from getting stuck due to not having enough resources to build the marketplace. In multiplayer games, this prevents the need to restart entirely or demolish buildings for wood when a trading post is forgotten.

o_gamespeed_descr: |
  Enable the change of the gamespeed as follows:
  - From 10 to 90 in intervals of 5

  Only the strolling through the castle is skipped until no more wounded targets are in the area.
o_increase_path_update_tick_rate: more frequent checking for available paths
o_increase_path_update_tick_rate_descr: |
